# **Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands**

## **The `grep` command**

### **`grep -r`**

The r stands for recursive, in which this command will run to recursively search through all the files in the directory you are currently in. Given a string to search for, it will print the section of the file that contains the word and highlights it. This is useful to search through all the files within the given directory including the folders within it, rather than having to cd into each folder to search through each file.

### **`grep -i`**

The -i option of grep is used to ignore uppercases or lowercases, meaning as long as the words match, it would not matter whether it was uppercase or lowercase. This is useful because if this option were not used with a word that was inputted with all uppercase, then the matches would not show up because the computer would not be able to detect the match. Through these examples, you can see that the files do not show up unless the `-i` option is used due to the cases not matching up with eachother.
